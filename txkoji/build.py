        This calls getAverageBuildDuration on the hub for this package. This

        system.

        For now this is better than nothing, but I'm recording a few thoughts
        here for posterity:

        A more advanced implementation of for estimating build times would
        track unique averages per build target. Early releases of Ceph "Hammer"
        versions would build much more quickly than newer Ceph releases like
        "Mimic", and the current method simply averages all of them.

        Also, different Koji build targets can have different arches. When we
        build ceph in "newarch" side tags, those build times are wildly beyond
        the average, but they influence this average too, subtly throwing it
        off for the x86-only builds that I care about.
